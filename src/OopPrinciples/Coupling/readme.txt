It seems like you're asking about the degree of dependency between different classes, which is often referred to as "coupling."
In software design, coupling measures how closely connected different classes or modules are.
Lower coupling is generally preferred as it makes the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

If you'd like to analyze or reduce coupling in your code, you can:

1. **Use Interfaces**: Define interfaces to reduce direct dependencies between classes.
2. **Apply Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies into a class rather than instantiating them inside the class.
3. **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each class has one responsibility to reduce unnecessary dependencies.
4. **Use Design Patterns**: Patterns like Observer, Strategy, or Factory can help decouple classes.

If you have specific code you'd like to analyze or refactor, feel free to share it!
